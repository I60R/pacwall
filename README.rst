``pacwall.sh`` is a shell script that changes your wallpaper to the dependency
graph of installed packages. Each package is a node and each edge indicates a
dependency between two packages.

An `AUR package`_ is available.

* Dependencies

  * **A** *depends on* **B**: an arrow that points towards **B**
  * **A** *provides* **B** (**B** is a *virtual* package):
    an inverted arrow that points towards **B**
    (*applies only to Arch*)

The exact default colors have been taken from pywal's solarized theme.
See `Customization`_ and `Pywal integration`_ if you want to change them.

Requirements
------------

~~~~~~~~~~
Arch Linux
~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo pacman -Syu --needed graphviz pacman-contrib

~~~~~~~~~~
Void Linux
~~~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo xbps-install -S graphviz

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Wallpaper backends
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``pacwall`` tries to set the wallpaper using ``feh``, ``hsetroot`` and ``swaymsg``.

-------------------------------
Desktop environment integration
-------------------------------

Use ``-D`` to enable desktop environment integration (KDE Plasma, GNOME, ...).
You will be able to see the generated wallpapers in the graphical wallpaper picker.

DE integration requires ``imagemagick`` and if you are on X11, ``xorg-xdpyinfo``.
If you are using a Wayland compositor other than sway, you need to specify
the screen size manually like this: ``./pacwall.sh -DS 1920x1200``.

**WARNING**:
Setting a wallpaper in GNOME and the derivatives isn't possible with ``feh`` and ``hsetroot``.
``-D`` is *required*.

-----------------
Pywal integration
-----------------

Run ``./pacwall.sh -W`` to use colors set by pywal.

Some themes don't follow the color order convention, though many do.
If you use a scheme that doesn't, then the color description table
above may be partially invalid e.g. updates are highlighted green instead of
yellow and orphans are yellow instead of green.

-------------
Customization
-------------

Customizations can be made on the command line, see the options with
``./pacwall.sh -h``.

.. code-block::

    USAGE: pacwall
            [ -iDWULV ]
            [ -b BACKGROUND_COLOR ]
            [ -s EDGE_COLOR ]
            [ -d NODE_COLOR ]
            [ -e EXPLICIT_NODE_COLOR ]
            [ -p ORPHAN_NODE_COLOR ]
            [ -f FOREIGN_NODE_COLOR ]
            [ -u OUTDATED_NODE_COLOR ]
            [ -y VIRTUAL_NODE_COLOR ]
            [ -x ORPHAN_NODE_OUTLINE ]
            [ -z OUTDATED_NODE_OUTLINE ]
            [ -c ROOT ]
            [ -r RANKSEP ]
            [ -o OUTPUT ]
            [ -S SCREEN_SIZE ]
            [ REPO:COLOR ... ]
            [ GROUP%COLOR ... ]
            [ PACKAGE@COLOR ... ]

            Use -i to suppress wallpaper setting.
            Use -D to enable integration with desktop environments.
            Use -W to enable pywal integration.
            Use -U to disable highlighting of outdated packages.
            Use -L to label outdated packages using 'monospace 12.5pt' font.
            Use -V if you are on VOID LINUX (EXPERIMENTAL, SOME FEATURES DON'T WORK)

            All colors may be specified either as
            - a color name (black, darkorange, ...)
            - a value of format #RRGGBB
            - a value of format #RRGGBBAA

            If OUTLINE value is bigger than 1, then OUTLINE-1 additional circles are drawn
            around the corresponding packages.

            ROOT is the package that will be put in the center of the graph.
            RANKSEP is the distance in **inches** between the concentric circles.
            OUTPUT is the path where the generated image is put.
            SCREEN_SIZE makes sense to set only if -D is enabled and you're on Wayland.

            REPO:COLOR overrides the highlight color for packages from REPO to COLOR.
            GROUP%COLOR overrides the highlight color for packages from GROUP to COLOR.
            PACKAGE@COLOR overrides the highlight color for PACKAGE to COLOR.

Additional customizations can be performed by modifying the script itself.
The code in the script is well-structured (should be).
To discover the customization possibilities, read the man page of ``graphviz``
and ``twopi``, particularly the section on *GRAPH, NODE AND EDGE ATTRIBUTES*.

Tips and tricks
---------------

~~~~~~~~~~~
Pacman hook
~~~~~~~~~~~

``90-pacwall.hook`` is an example of a pacman hook that you may put into
``/usr/share/libalpm/hooks/``. It will trigger wallpaper regenerating each time
a package is removed, added or upgraded. **It's not a part of a package from AUR**,
because one is expected to customize the pacwall invocation and flags. Also not
everyone likes the noticeable delay that the hook introduces to pacman invocations.
`Pywal integration`_ doesn't work.

~~~~~~~~~~
Graph size
~~~~~~~~~~

If the graph is too large/small, use ``-r``.
For example, ``-r 0.3`` means that the distance between the concentric circles
of the graph will be 0.3 **inch**.
